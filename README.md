# GangaWatch

GangaWatch is a frontend website developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024 project. The goal of this project is to monitor and forecast the water quality of the Ganga river in real-time using AI-enabled Decision Support Systems (DSS), satellite data, IoT-based sensors, and dynamic models. This repository contains the frontend website, where users can visualize the sensory data and predictions related to water quality.
